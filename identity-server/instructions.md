The current repository contains  a docker-compose file with configured Postgres image
1. We need to start a Postgres container, for that simply use the docker-compose up command, which will pull a Postgres image and it will create and start the container. The docker-compose file is configured to run init.sql (./scripts/postgres/init.sql) file that will create a axiomzen database, with a user the same user. axiomze:axiomze. 
2. the repository contains "identity-server" binary file compiled on mac (intel)
3. please start the above mentioned file with a "migrate" command - e.g. - ./identity-server migrate. This command will create a schema in the remote database
4. now, we are ready to start the identity-server. The default (root command) will start the server, therefore you just need to start the binary file with no commands - e.g. - ./identity-server.   A configuration file (./config/config.ini) contains a bunch of settings. One of them is a port to listen to. By default, it is going to listen:8888
